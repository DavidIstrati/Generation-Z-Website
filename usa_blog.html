                                There are thousands of colleges and universities in the U.S. With so many to choose from, how can you be sure that you will make the best decision, especially when seeing that this is arguably the most important decision of your life?
                                <h2>Fame or what fits?</h2>
                                Getting into famous universities can be proved to be challenging. The Ivy League is known for its less than 5% admission rate. But then, are you even sure you want to study there? Or did you choose it for its fame alone?
                                Dr. Boze, a senior fellow at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) and former president of the University of the Bahamas, argues that you should value more colleges and universities that actually serve your purpose. During the years that were spent working with students, Boze has realized that one thing is absolutely essential when it comes to choosing your school: Taking time to value the pros and cons, especially since no one uni is the best at everything, regardless of its fame.
                                But where does one find the information needed to make this choice? Thankfully, Dr. Hurley has provided us with two free powerful tools: https://www.getmidegree.org/mi-universities, which is a website dedicated to finding more information about each particular University, and https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/, where you can find more details about the process of applying to higher educational institutions.
                                Now even though you have the necessary information to explore your different options, you might still ask yourself what the differences between certain types of universities are.
                                <h2>Different types of educational institutions</h2>
                                The use of the terms “college” and “university” are used almost interchangeably. College in the U.S., unlike the British Commonwealth and other places, are post-secondary, not secondary schools. Many “colleges” in the U.S. are excellent 4-year and graduate-level institutions, so don’t exclude them from your search just because of their name.
                                In general (but not always), colleges are smaller while universities are larger. Universities offer more graduate degree programs and a larger variety of programs of study.
                                <h2> Two-year vs four-year colleges </h2>
                                The name is a bit misleading. Historically, it took full-time students 2 years to earn an associate degree or 4 years for a baccalaureate degree.
                                <h2>Two-year colleges</h2>
                                These types of colleges usually offer Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees.
                                There are two basic types of two-year colleges:
                                Technical Colleges (Trade Schools): degrees usually considered terminal, as they do not transfer to other colleges or universities or degree programs
                                Community Colleges (CCs): Used to be called Junior Colleges because, with a few exceptions, they only offer lower-level tertiary education: certificates, diplomas, associate degrees. These are some of the most affordable colleges in the U.S.
                                The trick about CCs though, is that you can earn a degree at a community college and then transfer to another college and university. These are called 2+2 degrees.
                                It is worth noting that many CCs are commuter campuses, where students do not live on campus. As such, they may not have the same college experience as 4-year universities. Some do have dormitories or athletics, and others even offer a couple of bachelor’s degrees.
                                <h2>Public vs private universities and colleges</h2>
                                Public universities are state-affiliated universities supported by taxes. All levels and degrees are available along with a wide variety of subjects.
                                Because international (and out of state students) have not paid taxes in that state, they pay higher tuition than students living there.
                                Public colleges may be large or small, urban or rural. Residential or commuter campuses, open admissions or highly selective: uou may have all of those types of public universities in any one state (University of Texas, Pennsylvania State University, University of California, California State University, University of Virginia).
                                Private colleges and universities, on the other hand, are not directly supported by the government. Since they are funded by student tuition and fees, they are usually more expensive.
                                Many private colleges are affiliated with a religious order (usually Christian), but you do not need to practice that religion to attend them(Notre Dame & Georgetown– catholic, American University (DC), Boston University – Methodist). Many were founded to train ministers, but are now independent (including Ivies).
                                Many Private Colleges have large investments, called endowments, that allow them to give generous scholarships to students they want to attract because of their academic or athletic excellence or other talents and skills (George Washington University, Carnegie Mellon University, New York University).
                                <h2>COVID-19</h2>
                                A small change regarding the process of admission has been made because of the current pandemic. This year, SAT scores are no longer required for admission and as such, you need quality high school grades to be accepted. Scholarships, however, are still offered based on SAT scores.
                                In the search for the best university, consider what is a good fit for you personally, instead of how known that institution is. Making the right decision is hard, so ask yourself: Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond? More specifically, as Dr. Martin stated, do you want to be a regular student at a big university? Or do you want to stand out at a small one?</p>
