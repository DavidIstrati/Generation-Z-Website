                                On the occasion of the 155th anniversary of &ldquo;Mihai Viteazul&rdquo; College in Bucharest, Vlad Dr&#259;gu&#351;in, a former CNMV student, was invited to share his story and to tell us about the roadmap for opening a business, as well as how to achieve the American Dream. He is the founder of Candylab company in New York. 
                            </p>

                            <h2>The key to success</h2>

                            <p>The business world is difficult. Not everyone can establish a successful company. People only see the results of your actions, not the effort you put into it. That’s why Mr. Dr&#259;gu&#351;in spoke to us not only about the importance of  hard work, but also about the image of the business. Every toy that is made contains details that give it an unique look, making them desired by both children and collectors. Another important advice was that managing the business’ revenue is crucial, because it is very easy to go bankrupt.</p>

                            <h2>The Catch</h2>

                            <p>Maintaining a business implies overcoming some obstacles. Making a realistic business plan is very important for an efficient approach of the opportunities, but also to prevent certain risks. As the connections with the community are very important, finding a good PR agent is of major significance. Another obstacle is represented by various questions about the business that may appear throughout the years. Is this truly your dream? When are you supposed to know that you’ve made it? When do you sell your company? When is it going to be known internationally?, entrepreneurs, their maximum potential can only be achieved by having strong will, passion and effort.</p>


                            <h2>The story of Vlad Dr&#259;gu&#351;in</h2>

                            <p>
                                He dreamed that he would be an architect ever since childhood. He imagined how he would build the next skyscrapers or his own home, like any other architect. He studied at Mihai Viteazul National College in the class of 1992, then at the University of Architecture and Urbanism Ion Mincu in Bucharest. When he finally graduated he won the Visa Lottery and went with his wife to Chicago, where he lived for two years. In 2007 he came back in Romania for three years, during the global financial crisis. Althought he was born and raised in Bucharest, in 2010 he felt the need to go back to in the United States. This is how Candylab, a business that reflects his passion for architecture, was created. Because of an unpleasant experience with another business, he worked both for his business and had another job. In 2016 he decided to dedicate himself to his business only.
                                <br><br>
                                During the years he lived in New York, Vlad Dr&#259;gu&#351;in learned continuously, gaining experience from the jobs he had at big companies like NBA Store and Gensler. Most importantly he learned to have a correct perspective of things, to understand real life, because at the age of 23 he didn’t have the maturity he thought he had.
                                <br><br>
                                The idea for the company was to recreate the feeling that any child experiences when he goes into a shop full of candy. This is where it all started. A decisive moment in the evolution of Candylab was in 2013, when the first campaign of crowdfunding was launched on Kickstarter. The next highlight was the interview on CBS television. Following the interview, his sales skyrocketed: in just 20 minutes he received 3 months worth of orders.

                            <h2>Fun facts</h2>

                            <p>
                                The Saint Laurent company from Paris made an unprecedented order: two car toys, one with a leopard print and the other with a zebra print. Moreover, Saint Laurent had the fabulous idea of turning the Candylab toys into real life size replicas and display them in front of the shop.
